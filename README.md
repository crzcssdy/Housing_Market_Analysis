ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS TO LOOK INTO:
Any potential patterns at the metro level

Potential drivers may include state moving stipends, lower cost of living, differences in state laws/restrictions, quality of life, etc.
How do large major metro areas (i.e, NYC, LA) behave/differ versus other areas?
Maybe group metro areas into different bins based on size to see if any patterns or trends arise?
